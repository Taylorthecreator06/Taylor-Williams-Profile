# Welcome​

My name is Taylor Williams, and I am a sophomore majoring in Computer Science at Northern Illinois University.

I love all things tech! Some of my favorites are programming, Cybersecurity, and Game development! With my Computer Science degree, I plan to become a white-hat hacker. This means that I will hack into systems to determine if they are secure. 

### Background

I was born in British Columbia, Canada, and joined the NIU family when I was three months old. I come from a line of champion dogs known for their great temperaments and love for children. My breeder gave me special training to prepare me for my important role as a university mascot.

Before coming to NIU, I received early socialization training to help me adapt to various situations. This included exposure to hats, coats, loud noises, and other novel experiences. I'm known for my bravery and eagerness to try new things, which are essential qualities for a mascot who often faces unexpected situations.

When I'm not representing NIU at events, I enjoy playing with my toys, going for walks around campus, and meeting new people. I'm looking forward to fully stepping into my role and becoming an integral part of the Huskie Nation!
