I love all things tech! Some of my favorites are programming, Cybersecurity, and Game development!

### Background

I am a sophomore at Northern Illinois University, majoring in Computer Science. With a strong interest in cybersecurity and database protection. Outside of college, I enjoy playing guitar, playing video games, listening to music, and creating art. My goal is to pursue a career in cybersecurity to ensure the security of society's digital privacy. 

Before coming to NIU, I developed a strong curiosity for tech. In high school, I developed a strong curiosity for technology. I explored some programming classes in Python, and they really piqued my interest. As time went on, I began to learn more languages, such as C++, Java, and Bash.
