  <summary>BP-01: Discovering Open Source</summary>
  
## Prompt
> “What is open source? What surprised me? Which well-known companies and projects use open source, and why does that matter?”

## What is open source?
Open source projects are projects that have become publicly available so that people can access the code freely. This lets users:

* Use the software
* Modify the software
* Distribute the software
* Collaborate and contribute

## What surprised me?
I'm fairly new to open source, so there is a lot that surprised me. I didn't realize how many open-source software applications I use. I wasn't aware that VSCode or Kali Linux was open source! I've been using both for quite a while.

## Which well-known companies and projects use open source, and why does that matter?
__Google__
- Android
- Chromium

__Microsoft__
- Visual Studio Code
- Power Toys

__Apple__
- Swift
- Webkit

This matters because so much software we use daily is open source. This allows other developers to make changes and possibly enhance the code, or using it to develop their own projects. This invites even more open source projects to be accessible!

  <summary> BP-02: Github & Markdown</summary>
 ## Prompt
> “What I learned about Markdown and Git, and how they help me contribute to open source and improve professionally. Have you used them before? What surprised you about Markdown or Git?”

## What I learned about Markdown and Git
Previously, I thought Git and GitHub were the same thing. But I learned that Git and GitHub are two distinct things. _Git_ is a free, open-source command-line tool that utilizes version control. Version control allows Git to record and track changes to files over time, enabling users to refer to previous versions to further develop a project. _GitHub_ is a web-based platform that can host Git repositories. GitHub is also cloud-based and offers many collaboration tools. _Markdown_ has become easier for me. In the first and second weeks, I really disliked markdown because it's a lot different than what I'm used to. But as I've gotten more comfortable using it, Markdown has grown on me a bit.

## How did it help me contribute to open source and improve professionally?
Git has helped me get better at version control by committing the changes and merging/pulling code. Markdown has helped me better explain my code and improve my organizational skills. This is great for professional environments. On a team, your code needs to be readable as well as clear and direct.

## Have you used them before?
No. I've done command line programming in the past, but I've never used Git or Markdown before this course. I'm still not very fond of GitHub, so I'm trying to explore all of its components before I decide if I actually like it or not. 

## What surprised you about Markdown or Git?
What surprised me about Markdown was how Simple but helpful it is. It's just clean formatting, but it has helped me become better at describing what's actually happening in a structure. Not much surprised me about Git because I've done UNIX/Linux in the past, so a lot of it was just a recap of what I knew.

  <summary>BP-03: Explore Open Source Projects</summary>
  
## Prompt
> Blog Prompt: “How I chose a repository to explore and what I found interesting about its structure, community, and contribution process.”

## How did I find this repository?
The open source project I have found is called [Pi-hole](https://pi-hole.net/). I found this repository while exploring the cybersecurity topic on GitHub. Pi-hole is a free, open-source [blackhole DNS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_sinkhole) (domain name system), which means that it blocks unwanted DNS requests such as ads or trackers. It does this by returning a non-routable IP address, which prevents those domains from being accessed on the network.

## What did I find interesting about its structure?
I'm very interested in all things cybersecurity. However, I was particularly drawn to this project due to the various features it offers. It not only blocks unwanted ads but also helps prevent tracking by malicious DNS. Additionally, by enhancing network performance it allows for a smoother browsing experience for all devices connected to the network. This is so important because in today's digital world, online privacy is constantly exploited. Having a tool like Pi-Hole can make a huge difference. 

## What did I find interesting about its community & contribution process? 
I like how diverse and knowledgeable the community is. It consists of beginners, experienced users, and the global, remote Pi-hole development team who answer questions and maintain the open-source software. The community actively contributes to the project through discussions, issue reports, and new feature suggestions. It creates an environment where everyone feels comfortable contributing and collaborating to create a safer and more enjoyable online experience.

  <summary>BP-04: "Reveal.js: My first deep dive into an Open Source Project" </summary>
 ## Prompt: 
> After exploring Reveal.js, describe how it’s structured, what it’s for, and what you found interesting about the way the project is documented and maintained. Could you imagine yourself contributing to this? Why or why not?

## How is it structured?
The [README.md](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/blob/master/README.md) is very clear and concise about what the repository is and how to start creating with reveal.js. It also describes how to install it locally and as a web version. There is also a very well-made [demo](https://revealjs.com/demo/) provided to help you get started. It ventures the user through all of the unique features it provides. 

## What is Reveal.js, and what is it used for?
reveal.js is an open-source HTML presentation framework. It enables anyone with a web browser to create beautiful presentations for free. It offers a wide range of features, including slide transitions, code implementation, and many themes! [revealjs.com](https://revealjs.com/).

## What did I find interesting about this project?
I am a very visual person, so I love that I can create beautiful interactive slides with open source! And at the same time, I'm coding in `HTML`! It showcases what open source can truly provide to different communities!

## Would you be comfortable trying to contribute? Why or why not?
No. I don't feel comfortable contributing just yet. I am improving with GitHub each week and familiarizing myself with the workflow, but I still feel that I'm not skilled enough to effectively contribute to large repositories such as [reveal.js.](https://revealjs.com/). I would need more practice because I haven't used GitHub that much before now, so my main goal is to improve so that I can understand the flow and navigate the platform.

  <summary>BP-05: Explore Open Source Licenses</summary>
 Prompt: “Ownership, Access, and Innovation: What I Learned About Licensing.”

Reflect on something you learned about open source licenses (e.g., MIT vs GPL, what’s allowed, what’s restricted).
> One big thing I learned about open source licenses is the differences in licenses that determine what is allowed and what isn't allowed. The MIT license has a lot of flexibility, allowing developers to share, contribute, and commercially use the code with minimal restrictions. The GPL license is more like a "shield". It enforces "openness" to help the projects stay free and transparent. It taught me that open-source is a spectrum. It can vary from minimal permissions to very protective sharing. 

How did the Tetris movie shape your understanding of software ownership and distribution?
> Reflect on something you learned about open source licenses (e.g., MIT vs GPL, what’s allowed, what’s restricted). Before this movie, I didn't know that licensing for video games can be "fragmented" across platforms. In the movie Tetris, the main character Henk is battling for Tetris's rights to arcade games, consoles, and handheld games. It was interesting to see the progression of the rights throughout the movie. 

What surprised or intrigued you about NIU’s approach to IP, patents, and tech transfer?
> The part that intrigued me the most about NIU's approach was the different Protections. Particularly, the Patent and the Trade Secrets. With patents, the value must justify the cost, and patents have a limited life. Copyrights should be used when secrecy is possible, and they last 90 years + the author's life!

  <summary>BP-07: Explore Non-Code Contributions</summary>
 Prompt:
> What counts as a contribution in open source? 
  My thoughts on the value of code and non-code contributions. 
  How diagrams help clarify workflows. 
  How communication and collaboration shape successful non-code contributions. 
  What non-code contribution opportunities did you find?

What counts as a contribution in open source?
>  To me, a contribution includes anything that enhances or supports a project. These contributions can be code, bug fixes, and they also extend beyond code to include documentation and design!

What are my thoughts on the value of code and non-code contributions?
> `Code` and non-code contributions are equally important in an open-source project. Code contributions build the core functionality of the project, as the code is what makes the project work. Non-code contributions, on the other hand, are crucial for user interface design and overall navigation. One of the most frustrating experiences is encountering a disorganized and messy repository where you can't find the resources or information you need. Therefore, contributions like documentation and [README](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/README) files are essential for helping users learn how to effectively use a project.

How do diagrams help clarify workflows?
> Diagrams clarify workflows because they provide a visual, step-by-step process that enhances learning and understanding for new users.

How do communication and collaboration shape successful non-code contributions?
> Effective communication and collaboration are essential for non-code contributions. Clear communication ensures that everyone understands the project's goals and objectives. Additionally, it helps writers produce precise documentation for the project. Collaboration brings together individuals from diverse backgrounds, fostering creativity and generating innovative ideas for projects
